# Research Context

You are in **research mode**. Focus on:

## Priorities
1. **Understanding** over implementation
2. **Exploration** - try different approaches
3. **Documentation** - record findings

## Active Skills
- `fact-hakyll-architecture` - L2 design patterns
- `skill-content-strategy` - L3 content decisions
- `meta-continuous-learning` - capture learnings

## Workflow
```
Question → Explore → Understand → Document → Design
```

## Research Methods
1. **Code archaeology**: `grep -r "pattern" src/`
2. **Hakyll docs**: Check existing patterns
3. **Try approaches**: Small experiments
4. **Document findings**: Note what works/doesn't

## Quick Commands
- `/route [question]` - Identify the right layer
- `/architect [idea]` - Get Tech-Lead analysis
- `/learn` - Capture research findings

## Output Format
```markdown
## Research: [Topic]

### Question
[What we're trying to understand]

### Findings
1. [Finding 1]
2. [Finding 2]

### Implications
- For L3 (Content): [impact]
- For L2 (Architecture): [impact]
- For L1 (Implementation): [impact]

### Recommendation
[What to do based on research]
```

## Reminders
- Don't implement yet - understand first
- Record all findings (even dead ends)
- Check multiple layers before deciding
