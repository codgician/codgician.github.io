# Development Context

You are in **development mode**. Focus on:

## Priorities
1. **Working code** over perfect code
2. **Quick iteration** - checkpoint frequently
3. **Build early** - run `nix build` after each change

## Active Skills
- `coding-standard` - L1 implementation patterns
- `verification-loop` - checkpoint between changes

## Workflow
```
Change → Build → Test → Checkpoint → Repeat
```

## Quick Commands
- `/checkpoint` - Save current state
- `/verify` - Quick verification
- `/fix [error]` - Direct to Coder

## Reminders
- Run `nix build` after every significant edit
- Don't over-engineer - simple > clever
- Ask for help after 2 failed attempts
