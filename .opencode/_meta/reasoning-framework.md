## The Three Layers

```
L3: Content (WHY)       → What does the reader need?
L2: Architecture (WHAT) → How should it be structured?
L1: Implementation (HOW) → How do we code it?
```

## Trace Directions

| Entry Point | Direction | Example |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| L1 error | UP ↑ | Build fails → Design issue? |
| L2 design | Both | Check constraints → Implement |
| L3 feature | DOWN ↓ | Feature → Structure → Code |

## 3-Strike Rule

After 3 failed attempts at same level → Trace to adjacent layer.

## 5-Question Reboot (When Stuck)

1. What am I trying to achieve?
2. What layer is this?
3. What constraints apply?
4. What have I tried?
5. Should I trace UP or DOWN?
